    "Title": "Membrane permeability in Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
    "Description": "MycPermCheck predicts potential to permeate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell membrane based on physicochemical properties.\nDue to the lack of reliable experimental datapoints, the authors defined the training set using molecules that are active against M.tb (MIC < 10 uM) (therefore, permeable) and have a molecular weight of <500 Dalton, and the negatives using a subsampling of ZINC. we have replicated the authors work using our own decoy sampler (eos3e6s) and LazyQSAR.",
