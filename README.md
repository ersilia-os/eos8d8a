# Mycpermcheck

Mycobacterium tuberculosis membrane permeability prediction

| Description | Input  | Output  | Training Data | Experimental Validation |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MycPermCheck predicts potential to permeate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell membrane based on physicochemical properties | SMILES | FOSA, accptHB, PISA, logP, glob | 3,727 compounds | No |

**FOSA is hydrophobic component of the total solvent accessible surface area; PISA is hydrophilic component of the total solvent accessible surface area, and accptHB is the estimated number of hydrogen bonds that would be accepted by the solute from water molecules in an aqueous solution**
